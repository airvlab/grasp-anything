Welcome to the official webpage of the Grasp-Anything research project, where we explore the frontier of robotic grasp detection through the lens of advanced foundation models. Our project represents a pivotal shift in how large-scale grasp datasets are synthesized and utilized in the realm of.

## About Our Research

Our journey began with the creation of the Grasp-Anything dataset, a comprehensive collection designed to address the diversed and lab-controlled challenges of robotic grasping through a combination of foundation models. This endeavor has expanded into a series of follow-up works that further the field of robotics by introducing innovative methodologies and approaches for grasp detection.
